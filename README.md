# Face Recognition Attendance System
### ● Overview

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based project that uses computer vision to automatically mark attendance using facial recognition.
It saves time , reduces manual effort , and prevents proxy attendance .

---

### ● Technologies Used

 Python

 OpenCV

 Haar Cascade Classifier

 LBPH Face Recognizer

 NumPy


 ### ● Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

git clone https://github.com/AtharvaGawande14/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System.git
cd Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

pip install -r requirements.txt

python create_dataset.py

python trainer.py

python recognizer.py
 

 ### ● How It Works

 Create Dataset – Captures face images using a webcam

 Train Model – Trains the system using collected images

 Recognize Face – Detects and recognizes faces to mark attendance
 

 ### ● Project Files

 create_dataset.py – Collects face samples

 trainer.py – Trains the face recognition model

 recognizer.py – Recognizes faces & marks attendance

 haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml – Face detection model

 requirements.txt – Required dependencies
 

### ● How to Run

pip install -r requirements.txt
python create_dataset.py
python trainer.py
python recognizer.py


### ● Features

 Automatic attendance marking

 Real-time face recognition

 No proxy attendance

 User-friendly system


 ### ● Note

Dataset images and trained model files are generated locally and are not uploaded to GitHub for privacy & security reasons.
